M# Hospitals Linear Regression

## Objective

This project objective is to analyze data from hospitals in the USA, in order to identify which variables interfere with the internation period of a patient.


## Justification

As a training project for Linear Regression, Professor Maria Teresa Leao suggested our group to address a dataset consisting of data from 113 hospitals from the United States between 1975 and 1976. During our analysis, we were asked to answer 2 main questions:

1. Is the number of nurses in a hospital associated with region, available services and infrastructure?
2. Is the internation period associated with the patient individual characteristics, their treatment and the specific hospital?

Hence, we delved into various Linear Regression techniques, as well as Exploratory Analysis and Hypothesis Testing as a means to answer those two questions.


## Choices and Metodology

The data was kindly handed by Professor Leao in a good condition, only requiring some minor adjustments for readability purposes. However, the original dataset had to be divided into two different ones: the training and the validation one. For this purpose, we followed a rather unusual approach with a 50/50% split on the data, as suggested by Professor Leao.

With the split completed, we constructed the theoretical models for both questions, and followed with a series of Exploratory Analysis and Hypothesis Tests about the variables and the models. Utilizing all the knowledge gathered in the former steps, we went to the modeling phase prepared with what to expect.

In the end, we were able to build a robust model for both questions, which helped to better understand what variables can be considered significant in each case. Some insights were discovered, such as the "age" variable not being significant for a patient's recovery during internation. 

Overall, the whole project can be considered as a very complete statistical study over a dataset, abording many aspects of visual resources about data, tests and modeling. The complete analysis can be found in the "Trabalho-Final.Rmd" file, even though it is written in Portuguese. It is also important to note that there are required files for sucessfully knitting the respective PDF, and they must be in the same directory as the .Rmd file.
